When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am collaborating with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might be working on something different locally and original code might break it .

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks means copying someone's repo directly on github and their name is shown on github . Clones means copying repo on your computer and branches are where commits are stored and there can be different branches to make bigger changes.
