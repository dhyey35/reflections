How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It was very helpful as you can directly concentrate on lines that have changes instead of going through each and every line and comparing manually.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can easily fallback on older code if new code isnt working or you want to refer to an older code for other purposes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Git:
pros- you can select when to commit and avoid too few or too many versions
con- you might forget to save a version (commit)
Google Docs:
pros-automatic saving so no need to worry 
cons-there might be too few or too many versions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Usually there are multiple files while coding in building a project so git allows saving multiple files in one commit while google docs is usually used to store photos , files , music etc ..

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows all the commits till date along with commit id and message while git diff is used to compare two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
you can always go back !!
