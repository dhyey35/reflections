What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It gives you a message that repo has been initialised and it is required to take benefits of git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is temporary , it helps in holding files that we want to commit .

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
We can add files with changes via git add command and then commit when we feel it has a logical change.
